# Task Manager

This is a Task Manager application built using Next.js v15 and tRPC, exposing the backend on the same port. This document deatils some of the features developed and the decisions I made during the build process.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the project repository by runnig:

```
git clone git@github.com:RodrigoTRS/task-manager.git
```

2. Install dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the application locally by running:

```
npm run dev
```

## Extra

How to build the application:

```
npm run build
```

How to run the build:

```
npm run start
```

## Decisions

- <b>Tasks stores in a local file:</b> Instead of relying on an in-memory array, I opted to persist tasks in a local file. This approach avoids losing data on server restarts, which helps during development to test infinite scroll, and enables server-side revalidation, which wouldnâ€™t be possible if the data existed only in memory.
- <b>Hybrid Server/Client tasks fetch:</b> On initial page load, the interface is server-side rendered with 8 tasks, which is enough to fill the desktop screen. For additional tasks, I implemented infinite scroll using the react-intersection-observer library, which detects when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and triggers client-side fetches to load more tasks dynamically.
